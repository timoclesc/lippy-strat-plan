                        <p>On behalf of Ellipsis Ultimate, I am excited to introduce our three-year Strategic Plan.</p>
                        <p>This Strategic Plan represents months of hard work, consultation and debate across our club, with engagement from past and present members.</p>
                        <p>It guides the new direction of Ellipsis, bringing in a range of fresh ideas while retaining the parts of our culture that we value the most.</p>
                        <p class="m-bx3">The Strategic Plan provides a framework for Ellipsis to continue evolving to best serve our community and our members.</p>

                        <p>Ellipsis was formed in 2013 with a vision to promote and encourage female athletes through the sport of Ultimate. Originally a mixed club, Ellipsis quickly achieved international success at the Asia Oceanic Club Championships, the US Open Championships, and the Vietnam Cup. Through each of these campaigns, Ellipsis focused on providing opportunities for our female athletes to lead and to thrive.</p>
                        <p>In 2016, we turned our focus to the Women’s division, starting a run to 5 consecutive National Championships. Each of these teams were built around a shared commitment to growth and hard work. Since 2016, our female players have taken on every opportunity to develop their individual skills, and have been key contributors across u24 and open age Australian representative teams</p>

                        <p>2019 saw another big change for Ellipsis as we welcomed a Men’s team to the club. The formation of this team alongside an established Women’s team was a first in Australian Ultimate. The Ellipsis men have been strong ambassadors for the club on and off the field, and have opened up unique opportunities for the club to continue developing.</p>
                        <p>Our journey so far has enabled us to build a strong and supportive community of athletes with a culture and work ethic we are proud of. Now, we are excited to look towards what more we can offer our community in the future.</p>

                    <p>
                        We will do this through focusing on three key areas: Our Sport, Our Club and Our Community.
                    </p> 
                    <ul class="charcoal">
                        <li>Our Sport represents the on field aspects of Ultimate. </li>
                        <li>Our Club represents the elements of Ellipsis that impact our members’ experiences. </li>
                        <li>Our Community represents the local and national Ultimate community that we are all a part of</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="m-bx3 m-sm-bx6">
                        Through maintaining a focus on these three areas, we will ensure we build on our history of on-field success, while also creating a club culture that can be enjoyed by our members and our community.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="sub-heading">Aspirations</h3>
                    <p class="m-bx6 m-sm-bx12">
                        In each of these focus areas, we have set clear aspirations for the next three years. These aspirations will guide our efforts and ensure we are continuing to make steady progress towards our Mission. Under each aspiration, we have listed key activities that are being implemented across the club.
